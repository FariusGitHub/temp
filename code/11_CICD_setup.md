# CREATE, LAUNCH AND CONFIGURE JENKINS
Many of the process here was inspired by my previous blog on https://github.com/FariusGitHub/Example_Webpage </br>
It was a heavy approach with a web app and docker-in-docker application where we will not use them all in this case.

Assuming docker already installed, herewith some common procedure and expected output.

jenkins@ceb8ac595bdf:/$ cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
  d96fXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXb5c
```

Remember that /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword is only accessible inside the docker container. </br>
When we go to localhost:8080, we shall enter above password as an admin user. And I will leave the same going forward.

Remember to go inside the container as root (-u 0) so you can install update and run as sudo easily. </br>
Since we setup above jenkins inside Docker container, we may install a lightweight docker inside docker. </br>
We would notice that the same goovy command below will make a different.
```txt
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                sh"""
                
                docker login --username ftjioesman --password XXXXXXX
                
                """
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Before we install docker inside a docker would see this

After we install docker insider container 54ed18a5d8a1 as follow, we would see below
```txt
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker.io
```
